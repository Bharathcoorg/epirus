# Epirus Substrate Explorer

Blockchain explorer for Substrate chains with a focus on the [contracts pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/contracts) and [ink!](https://ink.substrate.io/)

## Overview

The system presents two main subsystems:

**1. [Explorer UI](explorer-ui/)**

The explorer UI provides a user-friendly application to interact with the Squid Ink GraphQL API.

**2. [Squid Ink](squid-ink/)**

The Squid transforms data from a [Squid Archive](https://docs.subsquid.io/docs/archives/how-to-launch-a-squid-archive), stores it and exposes a GraphQL API for the UI.

## Others

### Local Development Network
